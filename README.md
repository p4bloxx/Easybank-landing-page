## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (Preprocessor) for CSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- SCSS syntax
- SASS variables
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this challenge I continued to practice with the various layouts, and in particular I had some problems regarding the setting of the hero section, and the manipulation of the svg images present, but overall it was very useful and I think I found a solution quite correct for the various displays of screen sizes.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing similar layouts, and at an even higher level, to try to find solutions like in this case, not always at a glance, to expand my wealth of experiences ;)
